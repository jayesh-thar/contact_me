# 🌐 Contact Hub – by Jayesh

A minimal yet expressive contact space designed to make connecting with me simple, professional, and memorable.  
This webpage reflects my personality, aesthetics, and developer identity in one clean interface.

---

## ✨ Highlights
- ⚡ Smooth and elegant GSAP animations  
- 🎨 Modern UI powered by Tailwind CSS  
- 🔗 Central hub for all my developer & social platforms  
- 📱 Fully responsive across all screen sizes  
- 🧩 “Portfolio coming soon” section — the next chapter

---

## 🔗 Platforms Included
LinkedIn • GitHub • LeetCode • CodeChef • X • Reddit

Every link is presented as a **card with an icon, badge, and hover interaction** for a professional touch.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
Instead of scattering links everywhere, this page acts as  
a **single identity hub** — a place to reach me, collaborate, hire, or network.

Whether you're a recruiter, developer, designer, or future teammate —  
**I'm just one tap away.**

---

## 🧠 Design Thought
> Not just a list of links, but a subtle showcase of animation, layout, and attention to detail.

Clean. Fast. Familiar. Personal.

## 📌 Next Steps (Coming Soon)
- Full portfolio with case studies & projects  
- Resume / CV download button  
- Contact form with email automation
